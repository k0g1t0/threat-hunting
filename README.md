# 🕵️‍♂️ Threat Hunting

Welcome to my repository of **threat hunting challenge writeups** — a collection of case studies where I investigate suspicious activity, dissect attacker behavior, and refine detection strategies.

## 🔍 What is Threat Hunting?

**Threat hunting** is a proactive cybersecurity practice focused on detecting threats that may have slipped past automated defenses. Instead of waiting for alerts to trigger, threat hunters actively explore systems, logs, and network data to uncover signs of compromise.

Key elements of threat hunting:

- **Hypothesis-Driven**: Each hunt begins with a question — e.g., _“Could an attacker be using PowerShell to maintain persistence?”_
- **Data-Centric**: Analysts dig into telemetry from endpoints, logs, and network traffic to validate or dismiss their hypotheses.
- **Behavior-Focused**: The goal is to identify attacker techniques, not just indicators.
- **Detection-Oriented**: Findings are often turned into new detection rules or improvements to monitoring infrastructure.

> "Threat hunting is about **thinking like an adversary** — then using that mindset to uncover the things your tools missed."

## 🧰 Hunt Template

I use a simple workflow for all my writeups:

- 📌 Hypothesis  
- 🔍 Data sources reviewed  
- 🧰 Tools used  
- 🧠 Key queries  
- ⚠️ Indicators and findings  
- 🧪 Detection ideas  
- 🧾 Lessons learned  

## ✍️ Why These Writeups?

This repo serves as:

- A knowledge base of practical blue team investigations
- A way to share methodologies and lessons learned with others
- A personal record of growth in adversary detection and analysis

Whether you're an aspiring threat hunter or a seasoned SOC analyst, I hope these writeups offer something valuable.
